The Sun is orbited by planets, asteroids, comets and other things.</p><p class="deskripsi">The Solar System is about 4.6 billion years old. It formed by gravity in a large molecular cloud. Most of this matter gathered in the center, and the rest flattened into an orbiting disk that became the Solar System. It is thought that almost all stars form by this process.</p><p class="deskripsi">The Sun is a star. It contains 99.9% of the Solar System mass. This means that it has strong gravity. The other objects are pulled into orbit around the Sun. The Sun is mostly made out of hydrogen, and some helium.</p><p class="deskripsi">There are eight planets in the Solar System. From closest to farthest from the Sun, they are: <a id="mercury" onclick="home(mercury)" href="#coverContainer">Mercury</a>, <a id="venus" onclick="home(venus)" href="#coverContainer">Venus</a>, <a id="earth" onclick="home(earth)" href="#coverContainer">Earth</a>, <a id="mars" onclick="home(mars)" href="#coverContainer">Mars</a>, <a id="jupiter" onclick="home(jupiter)" href="#coverContainer">Jupiter</a>, <a id="saturn" onclick="home(saturn)" href="#coverContainer">Saturn</a>, <a id="uranus" onclick="home(uranus)" href="#coverContainer">Uranus</a> and  <a id="neptune" onclick="home(neptune)" href="#coverContainer">Neptune</a>. The first four planets are called terrestrial planets. They are mostly made of rock and metal, and they are mostly solid. The last four planets are called gas giants. This is because they are much larger than other planets and are mostly made of gas.</p><p class="deskripsi">The Solar System also contains smaller objects. The asteroid belt, which lies between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter, mostly contains objects composed, like the terrestrial planets, of rock and metal. Beyond Neptunes orbit lie the Kuiper belt and scattered disc, which are populations of trans-Neptunian objects composed mostly of ices, and beyond them a newly discovered population of sednoids. Within these populations, some objects are large enough to have rounded under their own gravity, though there is considerable debate as to how many there will prove to be.</p><p class="deskripsi">Such objects are categorized as dwarf planets. Identified or accepted dwarf planets include the asteroid Ceres and the trans-Neptunian objects Pluto and Eris.In addition to these two regions, various other small-body populations, including comets, centaurs and interplanetary dust clouds, freely travel between regions. Six of the planets, the six largest possible dwarf planets, and many of the smaller bodies are orbited by natural satellites,usually termed "moons" after the Moon. Each of the outer planets is encircled by planetary rings of dust and other small objects.</p>';
